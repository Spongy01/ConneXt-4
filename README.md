# ConneXt-4
First Team Project, Computer Programming Assignment, A ConneXt4 Style Game with some gameplay changes of our own.

Team Members:
  Madhav Kanakhara(151),
  Amaan Mansuri(323),
  AliAsgar Padaria(219).

How it works?
  Copy the whole folder into your System and Compile the Main.c file and run it.
  For playing a Multiplayer Game, You will be required to add users from the Options Sub-Menu


SETUP:
Place all the flies in a single folder and compile and run the Main.c file.

--GAMEPLAY:

-Step 1:
  To play the game you need users so navigate to options in the Starting screen and then navigate to users to add users (you need to add two users to play the multiplayer mode).
-Step 2:
  Once the players are added, navigate back to Main Menu and go to play by entering 1 and then select MultiPlayer from the Game Modes.
-Step 3:
  Once in the MultiPlayer screen, enter the name of players you want to use(2).

-GAME:
  The objective of the game is to make a line your own token either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The tokens will be dropped from top so you need to plan your moves accordingly.

-NORMAL MODE:
  In this mode it is the basic game where the first player to make a line wins.

-ADVANCED MODE:
  In this mode its a bit different to the actual game, The first line made by any player will be deleted and the tokens above will fall into its place similar to Tetris and the player who has made the line will receive a point, the game will continue until the score difference between players is 2 OR the board has been filled.

-INCASE of a full board, the player with more points will win.

(the game is turn based)

P.S. Work in Progress. (Stay Tuned for Further Updates)
